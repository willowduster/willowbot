## Setup

### Standard Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a `.env` file based on `example.env` with your:
   - Discord bot token (`DISCORD_TOKEN`)
   - Admin user ID (`ADMIN_USER_ID`)
   - Discord OAuth2 credentials (see **Web Dashboard Authentication** below)
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```
   This will create the database schema and load items from `src/config/items.yaml`.
5. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   python src/bot.py
   ```

### Docker Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a `.env` file as described above
3. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This will:
   - Build the Docker image
   - Initialize the database
   - Start the bot and web interface
   - Mount the database file in the `data` directory
4. Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000

### Web Dashboard Authentication

The web dashboard uses Discord OAuth2 for secure authentication:

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Select your bot application
3. Navigate to **OAuth2** → **General**
4. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
5. Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:5000/callback` (for local testing)
6. Update your `.env` file:
   ```env
   DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/callback
   FLASK_SECRET_KEY=generate_random_secret_key
   ```

**Generate a Flask secret key:**
```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

See [DISCORD_OAUTH_SETUP.md](DISCORD_OAUTH_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

**Access Control:**
- **Admin** (your Discord ID): Full dashboard access
- **Players** (other Discord users): Can only view their own stats/inventory

**For Production Deployment:**
When deploying to Railway, Render, or other platforms:
1. Add production callback URL to Discord OAuth2 settings (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app/callback`)
2. Update `DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI` environment variable to match production URL
3. Ensure all environment variables are set in your hosting platform
